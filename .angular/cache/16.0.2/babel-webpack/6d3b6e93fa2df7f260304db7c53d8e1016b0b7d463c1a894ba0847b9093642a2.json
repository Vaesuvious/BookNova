Which is surprising. For some reason it seems like the older you get the less time you have but then again I'm only taking two college courses, so maybe its just me. Who knows. I grabbed some lunch from the taco shack across the street, then returned to my dorm. As I was about to eat, I heard a faint ring coming from my bag ring, ring, ring \\\"huh? Who is this?\\\" Looking at my phone I dont recognize the number. I was flummoxed, but then I though maybe its one of those idiots playing a prank on me. Well I'm not falling for it. I dismissed the call and continued with my lunch. A couple minutes later it rang again. I look again its the same unknown number so I answered \\\"Hello?\\\" Heavy breathing followed by a deep raspy. \\\"Raiiiizel I've been trying to reach you, you have a prophacy to fulfill\\\". With the voice so audiable yet unrecognizable it started to put me on edge. \\\"W-Who is this? Kate, Liroy, is this you? if it is I dont find this funny at all.\\\" The deep-raspy voice man laughed saying \\\"Foolish boy. I am neither of the friends you speak of, just know I'll be watching you blossom into the monster you're truly meant to be.\\\" The call ends. Frightened as I was. I threw my phone across the room, hoping to never recieve that phone call again. I decided to take a relaxing shower to try and clear my thoughts thinking to myself maybe it was just a prank. \\\"I can't believe thouse fools. They're gonna get a scorning from me tomorrow. I get dressed, lay down and pass out. \\\"I'm glad the days over.\\\" Then everything fades to black. \");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(32, \"ion-button\", 9);\n        i0.ɵɵtext(33, \"Previous\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(34, \"ion-button\", 10);\n        i0.ɵɵtext(35, \"Chapters\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd()()();\n      }\n    },\n    dependencies: [i1.IonButton, i1.IonButtons, i1.IonContent, i1.IonHeader, i1.IonIcon, i1.IonItem, i1.IonList, i1.IonMenu, i1.IonMenuButton, i1.IonMenuToggle, i1.IonTitle, i1.IonToolbar]\n  });\n  return Chapter2Page;\n})();\nexport { Chapter2Page };","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

"Go easy on \'em Liroy, it\'s been a long summer." Kate deadpanned. Liroy sighed "fine, but he\'s only getting three guesses." "Three? Come on theres so many games." "Only three dude." "It seems like \'The Great Liroy\' has spoken" Kate humored. You\'re dispicable you know that...I\'m going with War Raiders. Liroy laughed "all that complaining and you get it right first try.
